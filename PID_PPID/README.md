## About The Repository

Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell!

**Programs**

**which.c** implementation of which to look for the full pathname
 of the program such as ls.

**wait.c** suspends execution of the calling process until one of
its children terminates.

**strtok.c** function that splits a string and returns an array of
each word of the string.

**stat.c** function that gets the status of a file. On success, zero
is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

**shell.c** first version of a super simple shell that can run
commands with their full path, without any argument.

**setenv.c** function that changes or adds an environment variable.

**prompt.c** program that prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter
a command, prints it on the next line. (getline).

**print_path.c** function that prints each directory contained in the the environment variable PATH, one per line.

**path_linked_list.c** function that builds a linked list of the
PATH directories, each node added at the end.

**getenv.c** function searches the environment list to find the
environment variable name, and returns a pointer to the corresponding
value string.

**fwd.c** fork-wait-execve program that executes the command ls -l
/tmp in 5 different child processes. Each child should be created
by the same process (the father). Wait for a child to exit before
creating a new child.

**fork.c & fork_child.c** The system call fork (man 2 fork) creates
a new child process, almost identical to the parent (the process that
calls fork). Once fork successfully returns, two processes continue
to run the same program, but with different stacks, datas and heaps.

Using the return value of fork, it is possible to know if the current
process is the father or the child: fork will return 0 to the child,
and the PID of the child to the father.

**exec.c** Allows a process to execute another program, and the one
that was running stops. 

**env.c & env_environ.c** program that prints the address of env
(the third parameter of the main function) and environ (the global
variable).

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains standalone programs and functions that demonstrate key components of a Unix-like shell. Each file focuses on a specific concept or system call.

## üîß Programs & Functions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `which.c` | Implementation of `which` ‚Äî finds the full pathname of a command like `ls`. |
| `wait.c` | Suspends execution until one of the calling process's children terminates. |
| `strtok.c` | Splits a string into words using `strtok`, returns an array of tokens. |
| `stat.c` | Retrieves file status using `stat`. Returns `0` on success, `-1` on error. |
| `shell.c` | First version of a super simple shell. Runs commands with full path, no arguments. |
| `setenv.c` | Adds or modifies an environment variable using `setenv`. |
| `prompt.c` | Prints a shell prompt (`$ `), reads user input with `getline`, and echoes it. |
| `print_path.c` | Prints each directory in the `PATH` environment variable, one per line. |
| `path_linked_list.c` | Builds a linked list of `PATH` directories, appending each node. |
| `getenv.c` | Custom implementation of `getenv` ‚Äî returns value of an environment variable. |
| `fwd.c` | Forks 5 child processes to run `ls -l /tmp`. Waits for each child before spawning the next. |
| `fork.c` & `fork_child.c` | Demonstrates `fork()` ‚Äî creates child processes and distinguishes parent/child using return value. |
| `exec.c` | Uses `execve()` to replace the current process with a new program. |
| `env.c` & `env_environ.c` | Prints addresses of `env` (from `main`) and `environ` (global variable). |

## Compilation
All the files compile this way:

	$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file.c -o file

Then run the executable file:

	$ ./file
